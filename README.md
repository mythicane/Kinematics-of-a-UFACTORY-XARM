# Kinematics-of-a-UFACTORY-XARM
 
 The scope of this project includes mapping the kinematics of a 6-degree of
freedom UFACTORY XARM robot using MATLAB 2024a Robotics Toolkit Simscape, which could be later
defined in simulation. A situation involving arming the XARM with a sword of
previously defined length (with the tip of the blade as the end-effector) will be
utilized as the focus. By allowing an avenue for individuals to directly control
the angle of each joint, or find the angles given a coordinate, complete control
of the robot (and the weapon) can be simulated.

Project is for the "Foundations of Robotics" Fall 2024 Class at New York University Tandon School of Engineering.
